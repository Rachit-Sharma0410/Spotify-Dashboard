🚀 Thrilled to share my latest project — a Spotify-Inspired Analytics Dashboard built in Microsoft Power BI! 🎶📊

This dashboard brings together music + data + creativity, with interactive pages that make insights come alive:

Home Page → Clean Spotify-themed UI with smooth navigation (Home | Overview | Artists | Songs)

Overview Page → KPIs (Unique Songs, Artist Count, Avg Duration, Avg Popularity), Popularity Trends by Month/Year, Album Type Breakdown, Explicit vs Non-Explicit Analysis

Artists Page → Unique Songs by Artist, Popularity Ranking, #1 Hit Positions, plus detailed tables (release date, album type, duration, popularity)

🎵 Songs Page → Complete Song List with metadata, popularity, duration & interactive filtering for deep exploration

⚡ Through this project I strengthened skills in:

 ✔ Data Modeling & DAX
 ✔ KPI Cards & Drill-through Navigation
 ✔ Advanced Filtering & Visuals
 ✔ Engaging UI/UX Dashboard Design
